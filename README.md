WEEK 9
ASSIGNMENT: WRITE A WEB FRONTEND FOR THE ADDRESS BOOK

PURPOSE OF ASSIGNMENT
In this assignment we just want to create an initial web page for the application. It is up to you to design it as you think appropriate. Note that is doesn't have to do anything other than display static data; we’ll talk about connecting it up next week. 

ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS
You should have the outline for listing, adding, modifying and deleting addresses.

You should include forms to take the data.

Finally, you should include a separate stylesheet (CSS) file with styling for your pages.

Don’t work hard on making them pretty; instead, just try to demonstrate some of the basic styles.

This may sound quite complex for a single page so here are some things to consider:

Instead of writing this for an address just write it for a Person (with a firstname and lastname) as we used last week (and in the following substitute "Person" for "Address").
The page can be divided into sections:
At the top list the  addresses (include some fake data here).
After each address include a "delete" button or link that would send a request to delete the address.
Also include an "edit" button.
If one were to add JavaScript (not required) then this could populate the form below.
Alternatively it could reload the page with the person's information populated in the form.
In the next section have a form with the different fields of the address and a button to Add the address (if it's new) or Edit the address if it's an existing one.
Again, note that the page doesn't have to be interactive but it must all written properly so that if you had a server to handle it, then it would work without any changes.
